Sort an array according to absolute difference with given value
Given an array of n distinct elements and a number x, arrange array elements according to the absolute difference with x, i. e., element having minimum difference comes first and so on.
Note : If two or more elements are at equal distance arrange them in same sequence as in the given array.

Examples :

Input : arr[] : x = 7, arr[] = {10, 5, 3, 9, 2}
Output : arr[] = {5, 9, 10, 3, 2}

#My way

x = 7
li = [10, 5, 3, 9, 2]
li1 =[]
for i in li:
    li1.append(abs(x - i))

li2 = list(zip(li,li1))
z = dict(sorted(li2,key=lambda i:i[1]))
print(list(z.keys()))
